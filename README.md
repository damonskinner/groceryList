# groceryList

GroceryList is the first app I ever made, after 3 weeks in the Flatiron School iOS program.  

The app helps day to day grocery shopping by automatically compiling a grocery list for the user.  When the app first opens, the user is able to browse and select recipes, each of which's ingredients will be added to the final grocery list in the necessary quantities and amounts.  When the user is finished selecting recipes, they are able to open the grocery list, swipe to delete specific items that may not be needed, and then add custom grocery items to the list manually.  

Currently, the app is not connected to any API, and instead uses a stock list of recipes manually coded into the app.  However, I hope to soon get to work on brand new version of GroceryList, connecting with the Yummly API to provide users with a much larger array of recipes to choose from.
